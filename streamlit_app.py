st.write("In recent times, there have been several instances where government weather alerts arrived too late. For example, during the recent tragedy in Acapulco, Mexico, many people were unaware of a Category 5 hurricane approaching. These delayed responses by governments, not only in Mexico but also in the United States, underscore the need for more accurate and real-time data provision to residents, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding their safety.")

st.write("We aim to not only provide an exceptional app with precise features but also to create a complementary product. Our endeavor involves designing a light-up prototype in the form of a water droplet, which will assist individuals engaged in daily activities by alerting them to impending rain before they venture outside. Typically, people rely on a quick look outside for weather information, which can often be inaccurate. Additionally, this product will emit a brief alerting sound when it's raining, aiding visually impaired individuals in recognizing the rain and taking necessary precautions when heading outdoors.")
