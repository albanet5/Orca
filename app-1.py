st.write("In recent times, there have been several instances where government weather alerts arrived too late. For example, during the recent tragedy in Acapulco, Mexico, many people were unaware of a Category 5 hurricane approaching. These delayed responses by governments, not only in Mexico but also in the United States, underscore the need for more accurate and real-time data provision to residents, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding their safety.")
